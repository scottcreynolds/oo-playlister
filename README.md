# OO Playlister

Fork/Clone/Download this repository

run `rspec` from the project root folder

## Objectives

1. Implement the necessary code in app/models to pass all rspec specs
2. run `ruby bin/cli.rb` and have a functioning app

Feel free to push your own repo or gist if you want me to look at it.

## Bonus

create a file called `bin/generate.rb` that will generate a static html
site for the playlister application. Check out `erb` and http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html
